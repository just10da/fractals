Julia and Mandelbrot Visualization Tools

This repository contains Python scripts for generating stunning fractal visualizations. It includes:
	1.	Julia to Mandelbrot Transition GIF Generator: A script to animate the transformation of a Julia set into the Mandelbrot set.
	2.	3D Quaternion Julia Set Renderer: A tool to generate and visualize quaternion-based Julia sets in 3D with spinning camera animations.

Features

1. Julia to Mandelbrot Transition GIF Generator
	•	Creates high-quality animated GIFs of the transition between Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set.
	•	Supports:
	•	Customizable color schemes (ultraviolet, neon, chartreuse, etc.).
	•	Smooth transitions and pauses for dramatic effects.
	•	Dynamic zooming or scaling effects (optional).

2. 3D Quaternion Julia Set Renderer
	•	Generates 3D representations of quaternion Julia sets.
	•	Includes:
	•	Multiple quaternion initialization options for diverse fractal structures.
	•	Camera spinning animations around the fractal for captivating GIFs.
	•	Support for slicing 4D quaternions to visualize in 3D.
	•	Interactive rendering using PyVista.


Requirements
	•	Python 3.8 or higher.
	•	Libraries:
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	pyvista
	•	imageio
	•	moviepy
